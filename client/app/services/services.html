She will go through a comprehensive intake with you, touching upon your family and medical history. Bridget will gather as much information as possible in order to make the most informed suggestions about what herbal support would be right for you. Bridget may make nutritional, lifestyle, and herbal suggestions during your visit. After your visit, Bridget will compile the information you have given her and come up with a unique herbal formula for you, which you can pick up within a week.
