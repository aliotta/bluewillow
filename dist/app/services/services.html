<h2>Consultation: $20-60, sliding scale NOTAFLOF</h2>
<h3>1 hour</h3>
<p>
  You can expect to have a relaxed and detailed conversation with me in your first visit in which the we discuss your physical, mental, and emotional health history and current state as well as your dreams for your health. We will talk through a comprehensive intake, touching upon your ancestral and medical history, gathering as much information as possible in order to make informed suggestions about what kind of herbal support would be right for you. I may make nutritional, lifestyle, and herbal recommendations during your visit in a manner free of judgement and aware of cultural differences. After your visit I will develop for you a unique herbal formula, which you can pick up within a week. The cost of herbal tincture formulas is $13/oz, and I typically recommend starting with 4-8oz of medicine.
