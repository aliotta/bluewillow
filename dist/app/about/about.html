    I am a queer woman of mixed Middle Eastern/SWANA and white ancestry, currently living and working on unceded Ohlone land in the East Bay. I believe in providing compassionate healthcare to all people and am especially interested in supporting queer, POC, indigenous, sex worker, low-income, fat, neurodivergent, and trans and gender-nonconforming individuals. I do not believe in blaming people for their circumstances or their health statuses, but rather acknowledge that we live in a culture that denies access to health and supportive care for many individuals. I want to work with you to develop achievable strategies and tools for wellness that can be incorporated into whatever kind of life you are living. As someone who would have died of an asthma attack at a young age without an inhaler, I understand that Western medicine is necessary for many, and do not believe in shaming people for engaging with their life-saving and life-enhancing Western medicines. Rather, I believe that herbal medicine can provide complementary support that is imbibed with deep wisdom from the plants themselves and engage with this medicine as justice through healing.

	I completed my undergraduate degree in Education and Nutrition at Hampshire College in Massachusetts before moving to the Bay Area to pursue my interests in accessible healing. I studied at the California School of Herbal Medicine in 2014, where I deepened my knowledge of plant medicine, physiology, and biology. I am currently studying in Oakland with Ancestral Apothecary School, with a focus on ancestral medicine, accessibility, chronic illness, and dreamwork. I have studied with herbalists Atava Garcia Swiecicki, Elokin Ortun-Cheung, Kara Sigler, Tracey Brieger and Joshua Muscat. I have taught nutrition and health at the SAGE Project in San Francisco - a center providing holistic support to sex workers - and have taught classes on herbs for immunity and stress relief at Waltz Family Chiropractic.
